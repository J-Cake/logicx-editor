# LogicX

LogicX 1.0 was awesome. A humongous (for my standards at least) project I submitted for my HSC major project - one which would determine if I completed high school, so it was pretty important. 

As I'd been given a huge number of restrictions, I was limited in expanding LogicX's potential, however, what was achieved was wonderful regardless of its admittedly many flaws and bugs.

So I've decided to build the web editor from scratch using React, to make the application more connected, and focused on building functionality through extensions which connect to a common base.

Progress is good.
